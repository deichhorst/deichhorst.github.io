Notes: 
-This project was completed without any significant collaboration. I merely discussed aspects of it with Kevin Halliday, who is in the class this year with me. 
-This project took approximately 10 hours to complete. 

The purpose of this project is to create a person`homepage with links to bio and resume pages which, when combined, can give any potential employer or interested party information regarding Dexter Eichhorst's academic, athletic and personal pursuits and accomplishments.
